ForumApp is an app built in React.js with Bootstrap.
The main features are:
- Displaying posts fetched from Jsonplaceholder API
- Chatbot made with OpenAI API
- Users statistics
- Post filters and sorting options
- Searchbar with highlighted posts keywords

ForumApp is still under development, that's why we recommend using it on desktop.

  Attention!
  To make chatbot working, you need to create ".env" file in root directory. It needs to contain VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY variable with OpenAI API user key. (example: VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY = your key here)
