ForumApp is an app built in React.js with Bootstrap.
The main features are:
- Displaying posts fetched from Jsonplaceholder API
- Users statistics
- Post filters and sorting options
- Searchbar with highlighted posts keywords

ForumApp is still under development, that's why we recommend using it on desktop.
